# About templates
Templates are presets for the appearance of items, and can be used to apply a uniform appearance to _Presentation_ items.

Because Song, Text/Image, and PDF items do not all have the same options for appearance, templates have both universal and item specific options.

When adding an item to the _Presentation_, a template will be automatically applied to the new item. The template used can be changed with the option at the bottom of the _Add_ tab.  
Items do not store what template was used when they were added. To change the appearance of the item to a different template, or re-apply a template, open the item editor and use the template _Apply_ option.

# Template Editor
Select _Tools_ > _Edit Templates_ from the _Menu_ in the Control window, or click the _Edit_ (![edit](#edit)) button at the bottom of the _Add_ tab, or select _Edit Templates_ from the _Menu_ in an item editor.

On the left is a list of all templates, from which you can select, remove, or add templates.  
The currently selected template is shown on the right.  
At the top, universal options (such as background color) are shown. Below are item specific options, and an editor/preview.  
Different item types have different options & elements, to show these for a specific item type, change the _Edit template as_ option on right.
