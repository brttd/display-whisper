# Viewing Preferences
Select _Preferences_ from the _Menu_ in the Control window.

Preferences are grouped into tabs at the top, with sub-groups shown below.

## Keyboard shortcuts
To change a keyboard shortcut preference, click the button containing the current shortcut.  
Then enter the new shortcut, pressing (and holding) each key in sequence. When finished, release the keys. Then click outside of the input box to set the keyboard shortcut to the new sequence.  
Modifier keys (such as _Control_ or _Shift_) do not need to be pressed in order, and can be released or pressed at any time while entering a keyboard shortcut.
